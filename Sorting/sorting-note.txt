# Bubble Sort Algorithm
  -- Works on the repeatdely swapping of the adjacent elements until they are not in the intended (sorted) order.
  -- Not suitable for large datasets
  -- It can be used where i. complexity doesn't matter and ii. simple and shortcode is preferred
  
  # Deep analysis
  
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr) # gets the length of the array
    for _ in range(n - 1): # loop to handles the total no of pass is req to sort the arr
        for i in range(n - 1): # this loop handles the actual comparisons and swap the element
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]: # if the first ele is > then second ele then it needs swap
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i] # swaps the second ele with the first one
    return arr # returns the sorted arr after the completion of all the passes
    
print(bubbleSort([11, 4, 3, 7, 6, 1])) # output: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11]

# Time Complexity

# Best Case: O(n) --> When arr is already sorted
# Avergae Case: O(n2) --> When arr is in jumbled state
# Worst Case: O(n2) --> When arr is required to sort in reverse order

# Space Complexity --> O(1)

# Selection Sort Algorithm
  -- It is an in-place sorting Algorithm
  -- In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, sorted and unsorted part
  -- The smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to
     its appropriate position in the array
  -- Sorted array is placed at the left, while unsorted is placed at the right.

def selectionSort(arr):
    n = len(arr) # storing the len of array in var n
    for i in range(n-1): # looping for n-1 range
        small = i # storing the smallest val in small var
        for j in range(i+1, n): # looping for n range
            if arr[j] < arr[small]: # if arr[j] is the smallest ele then updating the small and swapping the val
                small = j # updated small
        arr[i], arr[small] = arr[small], arr[i] # swapping the values
    return arr # returing the sorted array

print(selectionSort([12, 31, 25, 8, 32, 17])) # output: [8, 12, 17, 25, 31, 32]
